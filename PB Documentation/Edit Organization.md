
## 1.1.	Edit Organization 
  
**Path:** Organizations  
  
  
After accessing a specific organization, the user can view various options and sections that display the key information defining the organization's specifications. To modify or edit the organization, the user must navigate through several sub-categories. They are: 

![Edit Organization]("Edit Organization.png")

### 1.1.1.	Organization Info 
  
**Path:** Organizations>Edit Organization  
  
This option allows the user to fill out all the essential and required information related to the organization. To access this page directly, the user can copy the URL displayed at the top of the page and share it with others. Once the URL is copied, the user can paste it into the browser to access the page directly.

#### 1.1.1.1. Basic Info
  
**Path:** Organizations>Edit Organization>Organization Info  
  
In this tab, the User can switch between different options according to his organization’s requirements. 
There are a few radio buttons that allow you to choose the following options:
##### 1.1.1.1.1.	Can be Affiliated to

(Pic) 

This radio button asks the users whether they will allow Partnerships or Affiliations with their organization. Affiliations can be described in various forms. 
For instance, in a franchise model, the parent company oversees individual franchise locations that are operating under the main branch. In this case, the corporate office is at the top level, and all the franchise locations fall under it.
Affiliated organizations may receive additional features, providing them with more facilities compared to those that are not affiliated.

##### 1.1.1.1.2.	Test Mode

 (Pic)
  
In Test Mode, the back-end users/developers can create a club and put it in the test mode only if a club wants to. The purpose of this mode is to provide an opportunity: 
•	For the users to explore the features and interact with them, as well as 
•	For our team to create test clubs with various scenarios to thoroughly test our product.  
  
##### 1.1.1.1.3.	Show to Public

 (Pic)
  
If this radio button is set to "Off," then it won't be visible to the public anywhere at all. This setting is useful when the back-end developers need a placeholder in place.

##### 1.1.1.1.4.	Show on Search 

 (Pic)
  
If the user prefers their club not to appear in the search results but still wants it to be accessible to its members or certain individuals, they can make it visible only to specific members by clicking on this radio button. 
For example, if the user and their group of friends frequently play together, they might opt to keep the club private. In this scenario, the user and their friends would have direct access via a private link rather than publicly displaying the club.

##### 3.1.1.1.5.	Include application fee when the customer makes a purchase

 (Pic)

This Radio button allows the User to 
  
###### 1.1.1.1.5.1.	Type (Types of Organization)
  
**Path:** Organizations>Edit Organization>Organization Info  


1.1.1.1.5.1.1.	Association 

If the User governs an Association, he may specify it under this dropdown list.
An Association is something that governs and promotes a sport or group of sports. It organizes competitions, sets rules, provides resources for players and coaches, and supports the sport's growth. They can also operate at local, national, or international levels and represent athletes' interests. Examples include Pickleball Canada and the International Olympic Committee (IOC).

1.1.1.1.5.1.2.	Club 

Clubs are places where groups of people gather to play games and spend time with friends. These clubs can be local, state-level, national, or even international. Being a member often comes with perks like access to resources, organized events, and sometimes even insurance.
  
1.1.1.1.5.1.3.	Company 

A company can specialize in a wide range of areas, including manufacturing equipment, providing sports-related services, or organizing events. They also have a wide range of facilities that includes, sports marketing and management, media coverage and much more.

1.1.1.1.5.1.4.	Digital 

A digital club is like an informal gathering where friends meet regularly, such as at a park, to run a league exclusively for themselves. These clubs lack a physical location and an official structure, distinguishing them as digital clubs. 

1.1.1.1.5.1.5.	Facility 
  
A facility can refer to a physical location where individuals gather to engage in their favorite games. It may include a designated play area where participants spend time playing and enjoying the game with their friends.
  
1.1.1.1.5.1.6.	Federation 

A federation is an organization that operates at national and international levels. It ensures fair play and that rules are followed in the events they organize. They also maintain the ranking system for tournaments or seasons.
  
1.1.1.1.5.1.7.	Franchisor 
  
A franchisor owns the brand and business model, setting standards, rules, and branding. Franchisees are independently owned and operated but follow the franchisor's guidelines and pay fees to use their name and system. This ensures consistent experience and quality across various locations all over the world.
  
1.1.1.1.5.1.8.	Government Department 
  
It can also be similar to how a branch of the government operates. For example, a central government body might oversee state tournaments. Here, the main organization (analogous to the franchisor) sets the overarching rules and standards, while various state-level branches (similar to franchisees) carry out the operations and events locally. 
  
1.1.1.1.5.1.9.	Not for Profit 

 A "not-for-profit" or non-profit sports organization focuses on benefiting the community or its members. It does not solely focus on making money for owners or shareholders. These organizations work to promote sports, physical activity, and healthy living, and any extra funds go back into their programs and services.

1.1.1.1.5.2.0	Park and Recreation

The user might have access to a park or playground where various friendly activities and games are conducted. These activities engage the community by organizing local tournaments and events to promote quality of life and wellness within the community.
  
1.1.1.1.5.2.1.	Pickleball Tour 
  
It’s just like the PPA (Pro Pickleball Association) or the Association of Pickleball Players. 
  
1.1.1.1.5.2.2.	Resort 
  
It can be a literal resort the user would go to on vacation which would have pickleball courts to play and enjoy. 
  

So, that’s the distinction among the various types of organizations. We group all of them into a product called "Organizations." When an organization is set up, we determine its type, and they select the corresponding category. 
Generally, the specific type of organization chosen doesn’t significantly impact the features available. We don’t restrict features based on the organization type, except in cases where affiliation matters. 


The following details illustrate the localization settings that assist back-end users in consistently displaying the correct date and time. This information is crucial for ensuring accurate display based on the club's location.
  
###### 1.1.1.1.5.3.	Country 
  
**Path**: Organizations>Edit Organization>Organization Info 
  
The User’s Country name is required so that the information is fed into the Organization’s info. 
  
###### 1.1.1.1.5.4.	State 
  
**Path:** Organizations>Edit Organization>Organization Info 
  
The user needs to mention the state of their country by searching and selecting from the dropdown list.
  
###### 1.1.1.1.5.5.	Time zone 
  
**Path:** Organizations>Edit Organization>Organization Info 

It refers to the time zone that the user follows. They need to specify the standard time zone for their location.
  
###### 1.1.1.1.5.6.	Localization 
  
**Path:** Organizations>Edit Organization>Organization Info 
  
It is going to allow the User to display the preferred local language. 
  
###### 1.1.1.1.5.7.	Currency to Collect 
  
**Path:** Organizations>Edit Organization>Organization Info 
  
Note: The User cannot change this after making transactions. 
  
The currency collected is the type of money that back-end users will receive for payments. This helps ensure clear transactions. For example, if payments are collected in USD but a customer pays in CAD, the system automatically handles the conversion. This way, back-end users can track the currency collected and know what currency the customer used based on their credit card.
  
###### 1.1.1.1.5.8.	Billing Emails 
  
  The user needs to mention an email address to which the billings will be forwarded after the completion of the transactions which will be done by the back-end users.

###### 1.1.1.1.5.9.	Title 
  
It shows the Title of the organization. 
  
###### 1.1.1.1.5.10.	Abbreviation 
  
 The Abbreviation represents a short form of the Title. This would be an acronym, like NFL or NBA; the abbreviation of the club. 
  
###### 1.1.1.1.5.11.	DUPR

DUPR ID can only be managed or entered by the internal support team. 
The entry and management of this information can only be handled by the internal team. While clubs can’t enter their own DUPR ID, the back-end team enforces restrictions to prevent misuse. This measure is in place because individuals may create multiple clubs and attempt to use the same ID for all of them, which is not allowed. 
  
###### 1.1.1.1.5.12.	Emergency Contact Required

This radio button asks the user whether to specify any contact details other than the primary contacts. The emergency contact is a required field where the user must provide details of a secondary contact, who will serve as the next point of contact after the primary contact.

###### 1.1.1.1.5.13.	Bypass Membership Approval Process

This radio button allows the user to make the decision to enable "Bypass Membership Approval Process" which should be based on his organization's goals, resources and the desired level of control over its membership. Carefully weighing these considerations can help determine whether this feature is in the organization's best interest. 
  
###### 1.1.1.1.5.14.	Allow Members to purchase additional credits.
   
This feature might be developed for promotions such as a holiday special, where credits are sold at half price supposedly between December 1st and December 31st. A different method may also be needed to manage credit purchases and pricing. 
For example, the user might have 100 credits on file with the club as part of their membership. While reserving a court, it could either cost $50 per hour or 75 credits, giving the user the option to pay with credits or money.

#### 1.1.1.2.	Fee Plan 

Fee plans will be applied only after adding payment methods to the Organization. Fee plans allow the users to choose different plans according to their requirements.
Following are the various plans from which the users can choose to go with:
. Basic  
. Premium  
. Enterprise   
. Custom 

#### 1.1.1.3.	Organization Rating 
  
**Path:** Organizations>Edit Organization>Organization Info 
  
To assess a Player’s skill level, the user can choose the rating system of his own choice.  
DUPR is the widely and most commonly used rating system. There are several rating systems that the user can choose which include:

DUPR- Dynamic Universal Pickleball Rating
CTPR- Club Only Ratings (WPR Rating Algorithm) 
USSP- US Senior Pickleball (WPR Raring Algorithm) 
  
#### 1.1.1.4.	Contact Info. 
  
**Path:** Organizations>Edit Organization>Organization Info 
  
Each club is required to provide their contact details, including a primary contact and an optional secondary contact. The back-end team will use these contacts exclusively for club-related communications. This information will not be publicly displayed and will be used solely by the developer team for communication purposes with the club. 
 
The above figure indicates that a primary contact is already set up. To add a secondary contact, the user needs to follow the same procedure as the Primary contact.
In this tab, the User has to click on the ‘Add Contact’ option to add a new contact.

 

A new option will show up on the screen to search for the new contact. 

 

From this tab, the user can search for a name to add to their contacts, and a list of matching names will automatically appear. To narrow down the results, the user can enter the full name to filter out other entries.
 
 By clicking on the “Add” option, the contact will automatically add itself as the preferred contact.

#### 1.1.1.5.	Contact Form Emails 
  
**Path:** Organizations>Edit Organization>Organization Info 
  
When the user fills out a contact form, there's a dropdown to select the 'Reason for Contact.' They can enter multiple email addresses. Our system ensures everyone listed gets a copy of the email. For example, if they select 'membership request,' all listed email addresses will receive the message. 

#### 1.1.1.6.	Social URLs 
  
**Path:** Organizations>Edit Organization>Organization Info 
  
This section contains social media links. It's straightforward and there's also a direct link to the club URL. Clicking this link copies it automatically, allowing the users to paste it into a browser and view their club. 
As the user sets up their club, they can see what it looks like live. 
  
Facebook 
Twitter 
Instagram 
Snapchat 
TikTok 
LinkedIn 

### 1.1.2.	Logo and Files	 
  
**Path:** Organizations>Edit Organization 
  
 The logo is crucial in the professional world as it helps distinguish the organization from others and gives it a unique identity."

#### 1.1.2.1.	Organization Logo 

**Path:** Organizations>Edit Organization>Logo and Files 
  
The organization's logo helps users be recognized and have their own identity. It also plays an important role in branding, marketing, and as a symbol of pride for members and participants.
  
##### 1.1.2.1.1.	Full Logo 

The user can upload the full logo, which will appear on the website when he searches for or clicks on a club. 
On this page, the logo at the actual size that the public would see can be seen.

Note: *The logo files must be selected within specific dimensions, as shown in the picture, and should be (800 x 400 px).*

##### 1.1.2.1.2.	Abbreviated Logo 

Then there’s an abbreviated logo or an icon logo, which is for areas where the user can see a tiny version of his logo on the screen.  
(Abbreviated Logo)
Note: *The dimensions of the Abbreviated logo must be 55x55 px.*
The uploading process for the abbreviated logo is the same as for the full logo. The user just needs to remember the size and dimensions of the logo.

#### 1.1.2.2.	Waiver

Waivers are managed in this section. The user can upload and organize various types of waivers, such as child waivers, membership waivers, booking waivers for reservations (like court rentals or ball machines), program waivers, and facility waivers.

Note: *There’s no limit on the number of waivers the user can upload, and easily replace existing ones.*

Users can add multiple types of waivers to their organization. To add a new waiver type, the user can simply click on the "Add New Waiver" option.
(Add new waiver)
After clicking the 'Add New Waiver' option, the user will see a window where they need to specify their waiver details, including the Waiver Type and Title, for better clarity.

###### 1.1.2.2.2.1.	Children

These are those legal documents that parents or guardians sign on behalf of their child before the child participates in a sports activity. These waivers typically release the sports organization from liability in case the child gets injured during the activity.

###### 1.1.2.2.2.2.	Booking 

Booking waivers are legal documents that participants sign when they book a spot in a sports event, class, or activity. These waivers typically release the event organizers from liability in case of injuries or damages that occur during the activity.

###### 1.1.2.2.2.3.	Program 

Program Waivers are those kinds of legal documents that participants sign to acknowledge and accept the risks associated with a particular activity or program.

###### 1.1.2.2.2.4.	Facility

After selecting the user’s choice of type of waiver, the user can upload the files that contain all the relevant terms and conditions for that waiver type.
(Upload Waiver)

### 1.1.3.	Locations 
  
**Path:** Organizations>Edit Organization>Logo and Files 
  
A facility can have multiple locations. For example, if the user’s club plays at five different locations/facilities, he would list all five here. The public website would then show all the parks where his club plays. Each club must have one primary location, representing the main place where the club usually meets.  
  
Under "active" locations, the user needs to specify if it is the primary location or not by clicking on the radio button. This primary location is mandatory, and only one location can be designated as the primary location if the user adds more locations.
The User then needs to specify his facility’s address by mentioning the name of the venue and an alternative name of the Venue. The full address of the venue is also needed including the street and postal code of the facility. 
The user needs to specify the Surface type of his court, whether it’s Hardwood, Asphalt, Concrete, Synthetic, etc. which gives us clarity on what the participants might be interested in playing on. 
The user has to specify whether his facility has indoor or outdoor or both types of courts. If indoors, then does it have air-conditioning or not? And, if outdoors, does it have coverings/shadings facilities? 
Again, the type of nets used at the facility must be mentioned by the user, if it’s a portable net or a permanent net or both.

**Path:** Organizations>Edit Organization 
  
This section allows the User to specify and connect to his Stripe account. He can also change the account by clicking on the relevant option. 
  
The user can't connect two different organizations to the same Stripe account. 
For instance, if the PPA (already set up in the back-end system as an organization) wants to create another organization but keep all Stripe transactions under their primary Stripe account, they cannot connect a Stripe account to pickleball.com twice.  
 (Connect Stripe_Checkout Options) 
When the user clicks on the "Connect to Stripe" option, a panel appears allowing the user to:
 . link an existing Stripe account already set up with one of his clubs.
 . set up a new connection.
  This means all of the user’s Stripe accounts from various clubs will be listed, and he can select and use one of these accounts. Hence, one Stripe account can be connected to multiple clubs. 
  

### 1.1.5.	Payment Methods 
  
**Path:** Organizations>Edit Organization 
  
This is how the back-end team handles payments. Customers provide their credit card information, and when they owe money, the back-end team automatically charges their card. The developers manage the cap on balances. For example, if a club's balance reaches $55, the back-end team will charge their account to clear that balance. This cap can vary; in some cases, it might be set at $2,000, and the developers control these limits, not the customers.

(Payment Method_Balance Cap(1))

Customers can add their credit card information, which will be kept on file for future payments. If they need to add another payment option, they can easily do so.
The user needs to link their payment accounts to proceed with future payments. To do this, they should click the 'Attach Payment Method' button.

Here, the user needs to enter their email and contact number to save their account with the "Link." After providing these details, the user can select either the "Save with Link" option or the "Not Now" option to set up their contact details later.

(almost there pic)

This will take the user to the final step of linking their account, where it will be indicated that instructions will be sent via email within 1-2 business days. Once everything is completed, the user will see that their bank account has been linked and set as the default payment method.

(Final pic_Stripe Test Bank)

The system will notify saying” The following payment methods are currently linked to this organization's account. These cards are securely stored and will be used for all upcoming payments”.

### 1.1.6.	Discount Codes (24:58)

4.	Discount Amount: The user should specify the amount or percentage that represents the value of the discount. This defines how much the discount will be worth when applied. 
  
5.	Number Issued: The user can define how many times the discount code can be used. This is useful for limiting the availability of the discount to a certain number of uses. If the user leaves this field blank, the code will have unlimited uses. 
  
6.	Date Active: The user can set the period during which the discount code will be active. This is done by specifying the start and end dates, such as from January 1st to January 10th. During this time, the code can be used to avail the discount. 
  
7.	Click on “Save”. 

  (Edit,Disable, Delete Pic) 
 
After saving the progress, the user can see a summary of the entries under inactive discounts that the user had made earlier. 
There are also other options regarding the generated discount code that the user will see after clicking the three dots. These options include: 
•	Edit- This option allows the user to edit all the details of the discount codes if he wishes to. 
•	Disable- This option disables the ongoing plan that the user has created. 
•	Delete- By clicking this option, the user will completely delete any discount codes that have been created. 
  
These above steps ensure that the discount code is set up with all necessary details and can be effectively managed and utilized.

### 1.1.8.	Managers 
  
**Path:** Organizations>Edit Organization 
  
 The users can have as many managers as they want. When adding a new manager, they can search for and select the manager, and then assign specific permissions. 
The primary manager has unique capabilities that other managers do not, such as editing, creating, and managing other managers and this page. The owner has the same permissions as the primary manager.     
All managers are listed here, and they can be disabled if necessary.  
To add a new manager, the user needs to click the “Add New Manager” option seen on the manager homepage.
 
(Add New Manager Pic_1)

Then another window pops up showing the user a bunch of radio buttons that allow a manager to have certain benefits. By toggling on different radio buttons, the User can allow a manager to have certain benefits as shown in the above figure.
The option to make any manager a “Primary manager” is also available in one of those radio buttons.
